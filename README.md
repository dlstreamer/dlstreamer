# [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) - DL Streamer repository 

## Overview
<div align="center"><img src="intro.gif" width=900/></div>

This repository contains GStreamer* elements that enable CNN model-based video analytics capabilities using OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Toolkit Inference Engine across all Intel Hardware. These elements can be used to perform use cases such as object detection, classification, recognition and tracking. The above sample video demonstrates the following GStreamer pipeline that executes face detection and emotion classification, using specific CNN models, on a video file:
```sh
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=cut.mp4 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! gvadetect model=face-detection-adas-0001.xml ! gvaclassify model=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.xml model-proc=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.json ! gvawatermark ! xvimagesink sync=false
```

The solution leverages:
* Open-source GStreamer framework for pipeline management
* GStreamer plugins for input and output, such as media files and real-time streaming from a camera or network
* Video decode and encode plugins, including either CPU-optimized plugins or GPU-accelerated plugins, [based on VAAPI](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-vaapi)

In addition, the solution installs the following Deep Learning-specific elements, also available in this repository:
* Inference plugins leveraging [OpenVINO<sup>&#8482;</sup> Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for high-performance inference using CNN models
* Visualization of computer vision results (such as bounding boxes and labels of detected objects) on top of video stream

In addition to the samples provided in this repository, please also review the following reference applications that use GStreamer Video Analytics plugin elements:
* [Smart City - Traffic and Stadium Management](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Smart-City-Sample)
* [Intelligent Ad Insertion](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Ad-Insertion-Sample)

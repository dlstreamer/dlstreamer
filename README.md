# GStreamer Video Analytics (GVA) Plugin

## Overview
<div align="center"><img src="intro.gif" width=900/></div>

This repository contains GStreamer elements that enable CNN model-based video analytics capabilities in the GStreamer framework. These elements include such things as object detection, classification, and recognition. Example above shows concise GStreamer pipeline that runs detection & emotion classification, using specific models on a video file:
```sh
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=cut.mp4 ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! gvadetect model=face-detection-adas-0001.xml ! gvaclassify model=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.xml model-proc=emotions-recognition-retail-0003.json ! gvawatermark ! ximagesink sync=false
```

The solution leverages:
* Open-source GStreamer framework for pipeline management
* GStreamer plugins for input and output, such as media files and real-time streaming from a camera or network
* Video decode and encode plugins, including either CPU-optimized plugins or GPU-accelerated plugins, [based on VAAPI](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-vaapi)

In addition, the solution installs the following Deep Learning-specific elements, also available in this repository:
* Inference plugins leveraging [Intel OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for high-performance inference using CNN models
* Visualization of computer vision results (such as bounding boxes and labels of detected objects) on top of video stream

The following diagram shows how the GVA plugin fits into the common software stack.

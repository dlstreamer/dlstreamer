# Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer) Samples

Samples are simple applications that demonstrate how to use the Intel® DL Streamer. The samples are available in the `/opt/intel/dlstreamer/samples` directory.

Samples separated into several categories

    * [Multi-camera deployments](./gst_launch/multi_stream/README.md) - demonstrates how to handle video streams from multiple cameras with one instance of DL Streamer application
    * [gvaattachroi](./gst_launch/gvaattachroi/README.md) - demonstrates how to use gvaattachroi to define the regions on which the inference should be performed
    * [LVM embeddings](./gst_launch/lvm/README.md) - demonstrates generation of image embeddings using the Large Vision CLIP model
    * [License Plate Recognition Sample](./gst_launch/license_plate_recognition/README.md) - demonstrates the use of the Yolo detector together with the optical character recognition model
    * [Vision Language Model Sample](./gst_launch/gvagenai/README.md) - demonstrates how to use the `gvagenai` element with MiniCPM-V for video summerization
    * [Custom Post-Processing Library Sample - Detection](./gst_launch/custom_postproc/detect/README.md) - demonstrates how to create custom post-processing library for YOLOv11 tensor outputs conversion to detection metadata using GStreamer Analytics framework
    * [Custom Post-Processing Library Sample - Classification](./gst_launch/custom_postproc/classify/README.md) - demonstrates how to create custom post-processing library for emotion classification model outputs conversion to classification metadata using GStreamer Analytics framework
2. C++ samples
    * [Draw Face Attributes C++ Sample](./cpp/draw_face_attributes/README.md) - constructs pipeline and sets "C" callback to access frame metadata and visualize inference results
3. Python samples
    * [Hello DL Streamer Sample](./python/hello_dlstreamer/README.md) - constructs an object detection pipeline, add logic to analyze metadata and count objects and visualize results along with object count summary in a local window
    * [Draw Face Attributes Python Sample](./python/draw_face_attributes/README.md) - constructs pipeline and sets Python callback to access frame metadata and visualize inference results
    * [Open Close Valve Sample](./python/open_close_valve/README.md) - constructs pipeline with two sinks. On of them has [GStreamer valve element](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/coreelements/valve.html?gi-language=python), which is managed based object detection result and opened/closed by callback.
4. Benchmark
    * [Benchmark Sample](./benchmark/README.md) - measures overall performance of single-channel or multi-channel video analytics pipelines

## How To Build And Run

Samples with C/C++ code provide `build_and_run.sh` shell script to build application via cmake before execution.

Other samples (without C/C++ code) provide .sh script for constructing and executing gst-launch or Python command line.

## DL Models

DL Streamer samples use pre-trained models from OpenVINO™ Toolkit [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo)

Before running samples, run script `download_omz_models.sh` once to download all models required for samples. The script located in `samples` top folder.
> **NOTE**: To install all necessary requirements for `download_omz_models.sh` script run this command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install openvino-dev[onnx]
```
> **NOTE**: To install all available frameworks run this command:
```sh
python3 -m pip install openvino-dev[caffe,onnx,tensorflow2,pytorch,mxnet]
```

## Input video

First command-line parameter in DL Streamer samples specifies input video and supports
* local video file
* web camera device (ex. `/dev/video0`)
* RTSP camera (URL starting with `rtsp://`) or other streaming source (ex URL starting with `http://`)

If command-line parameter not specified, most samples by default stream video example from predefined HTTPS link, so require internet connection.

> **NOTE**: Most samples set property `sync=false` in video sink element to disable real-time synchronization and run pipeline as fast as possible. Change to `sync=true` to run pipeline with real-time speed.

## Running on remote machine

In order to run samples on remote machine over SSH with X Forwarding you should force usage of `ximagesink` as video sink first:
```sh
source ./force_ximagesink.sh
```

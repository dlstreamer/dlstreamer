# Vehicle and Pedestrian Tracking Sample (gst-launch command line)

This sample demonstrates [gvatrack](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/gvatrack) element and object tracking capabilities on example of person and vehicle tracking. Object tracking increases performance by running inference on object detection and classification models less frequently (not every frame).

## How It Works
The sample utilizes GStreamer command-line tool `gst-launch-1.0` which can build and run GStreamer pipeline described in a string format.
The string contains a list of GStreamer elements separated by exclamation mark `!`, each element may have properties specified in the format `property`=`value`.

The `gvadetect` element sets `inference-interval` property to 10 frames in this sample, so inference on object detection model executed every 10th frame.

The `gvatrack` element inserted into pipeline after `gvadetect` to track all objects on remaining 9 frames until object detection executed again.

The `gvaclassify` element sets `reclassify-interval` property to 10, so inference on object classification model executed every 10th frames. `gvaclassify` uses unique object ID assigned by `gvatrack` to each object for copying classification results on remaining 9 frames from last frame inference was executed.

Overall this sample builds GStreamer pipeline of the following elements
* `filesrc` or `urisourcebin` or `v4l2src` for input from file/URL/web-camera
* `decodebin` for video decoding
* `videoconvert` for converting video frame into different color formats
* [gvadetect](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/gvadetect) for person and vehicle detection based on OpenVINO™ Toolkit Inference Engine
* [gvatrack](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/gvatrack) for tracking objects
* [gvaclassify](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/gvaclassify) inserted into pipeline twice for person and vehicle classification
* [gvawatermark](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst/wiki/gvawatermark) for bounding boxes and labels visualization
* `autovideosink` for rendering output video into screen
> **NOTE**: `sync=false` property in `autovideosink` element disables real-time synchronization so pipeline runs as fast as possible

## Models

The sample uses by default the following pre-trained models from OpenVINO™ Toolkit [Open Model Zoo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo)
*   __person-vehicle-bike-detection-2004__ is primary detection network for detecting persons, vehicles and bikes
*   __person-attributes-recognition-crossroad-0230__ classifies person attributes
*   __vehicle-attributes-recognition-barrier-0039__ classifies vehicle attributes

> **NOTE**: Before running samples (including this one), run script `download_models.sh` once (the script located in `samples` top folder) to download all models required for this and other samples.

The sample contains `model_proc` subfolder with .json files for each model with description of model input/output formats and post-processing rules for classification models.

## Running

```sh
./vehicle_pedestrian_tracking.sh [INPUT_VIDEO] [DETECTION_INTERVAL] [DEVICE] [SINK_ELEMENT] [TRACKING_TYPE]
```

The sample takes four command-line parameters:
1. [INPUT_VIDEO] to specify input video.
The input could be
    * video file path
    * web camera device (ex. /dev/video0)
    * URL of RTSP camera (URL starts with `rtsp://`) or other streaming source (ex `http://`)
If parameter is not specified, the sample by default streams video example from HTTPS link (utilizing `urisourcebin` element) so requires internet conection.
2. [DETECTION_INTERVAL] to specify interval between inference requests. An interval of N performs inference on every Nth frame. Default value is 10
3. [DEVICE] to specify device for detection and classification.
    Please refer to OpenVINO™ toolkit documentation for supported devices.
    https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html
    You can find what devices are supported on your system by running following OpenVINO™ toolkit sample:
    https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_inference_engine_ie_bridges_python_sample_hello_query_device_README.html
4. [SINK_ELEMENT] to choose between render mode and fps throughput mode:
    * display - render (default)
    * fps - FPS only
5. [TRACKING_TYPE] to specify tracking type. 
    Tracking types available are short-term(default), short-term-imageless, zero-term, zero-term-imageless.
    For more information on tracking types and their difference, please turn to

## Sample Output

The sample
* prints gst-launch command line into console
* starts the command and visualizes video with bounding boxes around detected objects and text with classification results (color, type and others) for each detected object or prints out fps if you set SINK_ELEMENT = fps

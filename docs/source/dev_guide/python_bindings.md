# Python Bindings

## 1. GStreamer Python bindings

GStreamer provides Python bindings in the module called **pygst**. On
Ubuntu you can install it through apt package manager as

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-gst-1.0
```

GStreamer Python interface has one-to-one mapping with C interface as
Python wrappers generated automatically via GObject introspection.
Similar to C/C++ the Python application can construct pipeline (either
from pipeline string description in gst-launch format or creating and
connecting elements programmatically), set pad probe callback(s) on
source or sink pad of any element in the pipeline, etc.

Please see Python sample
[draw_face_attributes.py](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/dl-streamer/samples/gstreamer/python/draw_face_attributes/draw_face_attributes.py)
as one of examples.

## 2. Video-analytics specific Python bindings

As GVA plugin registers inference specific metadata, another [Python
library
gstgva](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/dl-streamer/python/gstgva)
in this repository is complimentary to *pygst* and additionally provides
Python bindings for GVA specific types such as *GstGVATensorMeta* and
*GstGVAJSONMeta* and access to inference specific fields in
*GstVideoRegionOfInterestMeta*. Unlike *gstpy*, C to Python wrappers in
*gstgva* implemented via Python *ctypes* mechanism and designed with the
goal of one-to-one mapping with GVA C++ interface.

You can find the following Python callback function example of accessing
list of detected objects and objects attributes very similar to C++
function example on [Metadata page](./metadata.md).

```bash
    def pad_probe_callback(pad, info):
        with gstgva.util.GST_PAD_PROBE_INFO_BUFFER(info) as buffer:
            caps = pad.get_current_caps()
            frame = gstgva.VideoFrame(buffer, caps)
            for roi in frame.regions():
                for tensor in roi.tensors():
                    print("  Attribute ", tensor.name())
                    print("    label=", tensor.label())
                    print("    confidence=", tensor.confidence())
        return Gst.PadProbeReturn.OK
```

## 3. gvapython element

Besides Python binding for standard GStreamer and GVA plugin interfaces,
the GStreamer element *gvapython* from this repository could be used for
pipeline customization with code in Python language. The *gvapython*
inserted at any place of pipeline and takes reference to Python file and
function/class name as element property, and invokes provided callback
function on every frame.

The *gvapython* element could be used for post-processing of metadata
generated by inference elements (for example, extract list of detected
bounding boxes in case of detection model format not supported by GVA),
or perform some analytics based on inference results (for example,
compare face embeddings versus gallery of known faces).

The *gvapython* element implemented in "C" language as normal GStreamer
element and invokes Python functions via "C" interface (Python.h).

Please see samples for *gvapython* element in [this
folder](https://github.com/dlstreamer/dlstreamer/tree/master/samples/gstreamer/gst_launch/gvapython/face_detection_and_classification)

## 4. Performance considerations

Python code performance is typically significantly slower than C/C++
code compiled into native instruction set. The parallelization is also
limited as all Python code executed in single thread. If Python callback
contains compute intensive operations executed every frame, it may
impact overall performance and production usage may require migration
from Python to C implementation.

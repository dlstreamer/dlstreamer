# gvametapublish

Publishes the JSON metadata to MQTT or Kafka message brokers or files.
MQTT and Kafka methods offer reconnection in case the connection to the
broker is lost, or cannot be established. During this reconnection time, any
metadata that passes through the element will not be cached or
published. It will simply pass through to the next element in the
pipeline.

The MQTT configuration file used with the `mqtt-config` property should
conform to the following JSON schema. Values specified in the
configuration file override values assigned to the individual properties
listed above.

**Warning:**

This element leverages TLS to ensure secure communication while sending
MQTT messages. The paths to the necessary certificates and keys,
included in the configuration file, are passed to the Paho Asynchronous
MQTT C Client Library for establishing TLS connections. However, it is
important to note that storage, management, and protection of these
certificates and keys are beyond the scope of this component.

**Key Points:**

- **Certificate and Key Handling:** The plugin passes the
paths to the certificates and keys to the Paho library, but does not
handle their storage or protection.
- **Responsibility:** The
responsibility for securely storing and protecting the certificates and
keys (ensuring confidentiality and integrity for private keys and
integrity for public keys) lies with the external application or system
that uses this element. Additionally, the external application is
responsible for generation, provisioning, and removal of keys,
ensuring that these processes are conducted securely and in accordance
with best practices.
- **Security Measures:** It is recommended that
the external application implements appropriate security measures to
ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
cryptographic credentials.

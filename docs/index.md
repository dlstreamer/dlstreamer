# DL Streamer API reference
## Overview
This documentation describes DL Streamer metadata API (Application Programming Interface) that allows you to access and to control inference results obtained from DL Streamer plugin elements, such as **gvainference**, **gvadetect**, **gvaclassify**. In DL Streamer, all inference results (both raw and interpreted) are passing through GStreamer pipeline being attached to GstBuffer objects as GStreamer metadata.

For better developer experience we provide DL Streamer API (**C++** and **Python** versions) which simplifies any job you want to perform on inference results, like consuming and further reusing, additional custom post-processing, and more. Also, most of the times, DL Streamer API allows you to abstract from internal inference results as GStreamer metadata.

In DL Streamer API, most of the job is done by these classes: GVA::VideoFrame, GVA::RegionOfInterest & GVA::Tensor (**C++** version is referenced here, but **Python** version is available as well). Take a look at schematic picture below, which represents how these classes relate.

[imgDef]: @ref GVA_API.png
On this picture you can see 3 classes mentioned above. GVA::VideoFrame is the most high-level object, which is constructed from GstBuffer. It means that GVA::VideoFrame represents one image (one video frame). One GVA::VideoFrame can contain from 0 to many GVA::RegionOfInterest objects (ROI on picture above). GVA::RegionOfInterest describes detected object, e.g. its bounding box coordinates and label. Number of GVA::RegionOfInterest objects added to GVA::VideoFrame depends on whether detection already happened on this image (by **gvadetect** element in a pipeline) and whether this image contains patterns which are recognized by detection models (for example, it could be image with humans faces and detection model, which was trained to detect faces).

Similar, one GVA::VideoFrame can contain from 0 to many GVA::Tensor objects, which are products of running inference (by **gvainference** element in a pipeline) on full video frame. Such GVA::Tensor contains raw inference result which can be consumed and post-processed (interpreted) any way you like. For example, if you have custom detection model, which is not supported by **gvadetect**, you can run inference with **gvainference** element in a pipeline, and obtain results as a GVA::Tensor object. You can then use these results for getting regions of interest of this frame with your post-processing algorithm, and add your own GVA::RegionOfInterest to GVA::VideoFrame with GVA::VideoFrame::add_region. Below you can find [tutorial](#tutorial) devoted to this use case.

GVA::RegionOfInterest can also contain multiple GVA::Tensor objects, which are products of running classification (by **gvaclassify** element in a pipeline) on GVA::RegionOfInterest they belong to. Such GVA::Tensor can contain GVA::Tensor::label which is string containing interpreted classification result (examples are person's age, car's color, etc.). GVA::Tensor also stores raw data (model output blob), which can be obtained with GVA::Tensor::data. Normally, one GVA::Tensor contains some additional detection information, which can be obtained with GVA::RegionOfInterest::detection. You can check if GVA::Tensor is detection tensor with GVA::Tensor::is_detection. Detection GVA::Tensor extends detection information contained in GVA::RegionOfInterest.

Any modification you perform using DL Streamer API will affect underlying metadata as though you modified it directly. For example, you can add GVA::RegionOfInterest or GVA::Tensor objects to GVA::VideoFrame, and real GStreamer metadata instances will be added to GstBuffer of current GVA::VideoFrame. It means, the objects you added will behave as if they were produced by GVA elements mentioned above. You will be able to reach these objects futher by pipeline using both internal metadata representation and DL Streamer API. Also, any DL Streamer elements that rely on inference results will employ objects you added. For example, **gvawatermark** will render on screen these objects (for example, it will draw bounding box for added GVA::RegionOfInterest).

## Inference results flow
Video analytics pipeline is a GStreamer pipeline with one or several DL Streamer elements for inference and additional actions (publishing, rendering, etc.) if needed. Take a look at this pipeline:
```sh
INPUT=video.mp4
MODEL1=face-detection-adas-0001
MODEL2=age-gender-recognition-retail-0013
MODEL3=emotions-recognition-retail-0003

gst-launch-1.0 \
    filesrc location=${INPUT} ! decodebin ! video/x-raw ! videoconvert ! \
    gvadetect   model=$(MODEL_PATH $MODEL1) ! queue ! \
    gvaclassify model=$(MODEL_PATH $MODEL2) model-proc=$(PROC_PATH $MODEL2) ! queue ! \
    gvaclassify model=$(MODEL_PATH $MODEL3) model-proc=$(PROC_PATH $MODEL3) ! queue ! \
    gvawatermark ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video-sink=xvimagesink sync=false
```
Note: following explanation is based on **C++** DL Streamer API, but **Python** DL Streamer API can be used in the same way

Here, **gvadetect** runs face detection on each frame (GVA::VideoFrame) of provided video file. Let's say, it detected 3 faces on particular frame. It means, that 3 instances of GVA::RegionOfInterest will be added to this frame. Also, each GVA::RegionOfInterest will get its own detection GVA::Tensor attached. Such GVA::Tensor contains additional detection information.

After detection frame goes into first of two **gvaclassify** elements, which will iterate by 3 instances of GVA::RegionOfInterest added to GVA::VideoFrame. For each GVA::RegionOfInterest it will take region itself from full frame and run age & gender classification on this region. Thus, each person detected will also get age and gender classified. It's achieved by adding 2 GVA::Tensor instances to current GVA::RegionOfInterest (one for age and one for gender).

After first classification frame goes into second **gvaclassify** element, which does the same job as previous **gvaclassify** element, but it classifies person's emotion, instead of age & gender. Result emotion will be contained in its own GVA::Tensor added to current GVA::RegionOfInterest.

Thus, after detection & classification part of pipeline we have GVA::VideoFrame with 3 instances of GVA::RegionOfInterest added, and 4 instances of GVA::Tensor added to each of 3 instances of GVA::RegionOfInterest. On image level, it means that we've got 3 persons detected, and age, gender & emotion of each of them is classified.

Last DL Streamer element in the pipeline is **gvawatermark** and its job is to display inference results on top of frame currently rendered on screen. To do this, it creates GVA::VideoFrame instance for current frame and iterates by attached GVA::RegionOfInterest instances, and by GVA::Tensor instances, attached to each of GVA::RegionOfInterest. This way, you will see bounding boxes drawed around persons faces, and these boxes will also be labeled with age, gender & emotion.

The whole point of DL Streamer API is to allow you to access any object we described above in any point of pipeline. You can read it, modify it, add your own tensors and regions of interest, and so on. Thus, you can add custom post-processing for any deep learning model in case DL Streamer inference elements don't support it. There is a handy **gvainference** element, which adds raw inference result (output layer blob) in GVA::Tensor, so you can do custom post-processing on it.

## Print inference results example
Here we provide a few code snippets, which print some of inference results obtained from video analytics pipeline. They are different ways to achieve the same thing.
To get thorough understanding of how to create an application which takes advantage of DL Streamer API, make sure to check out the rest of this document.

### 1. Access inference results with low-level C code
This is not recommended way of dealing with inference results obtained from video analytics pipeline and should be avoided unless some specific considerations exist
```c
#include <gst/video/video.h> // contains GstVideoRegionOfInterestMeta

void PrintMeta(GstBuffer *buffer) {
    gpointer state = NULL;
    GstMeta *meta = NULL;
    while ((meta = gst_buffer_iterate_meta(buffer, &state)) != NULL) { // iterate by meta attached to buffer
        if (meta->info->api != GST_VIDEO_REGION_OF_INTEREST_META_API_TYPE)
            continue; // we only interested in GstVideoRegionOfInterestMeta instances, because it's produced by gvadetect
        GstVideoRegionOfInterestMeta *roi_meta = (GstVideoRegionOfInterestMeta*)meta;
        printf("Object bounding box %d,%d,%d,%d\n", roi_meta->x, roi_meta->y, roi_meta->w, roi_meta->h);
        for (GList *l = roi_meta->params; l; l = g_list_next(l)) { // iterate by tensors attached to this region of interest
            GstStructure *structure = (GstStructure *) l->data;
            if (gst_structure_has_name(structure, "detection"))
                continue; // detection tensor doesn't contain classification result and hence doesn't contain label
            // print some tensor information
            printf("  Attribute %s\n", gst_structure_get_name(structure));
            if (gst_structure_has_field(structure, "label")) {
                printf("    label=%s\n", gst_structure_get_string(structure, "label"));
            }
            if (gst_structure_has_field(structure, "confidence")) {
                double confidence;
                gst_structure_get_double(structure, "confidence", &confidence);
                printf("    confidence=%.2f\n", confidence);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### 2. Access inference results with C++ API
This is recommended way of dealing with inference results obtained from video analytics pipeline from C++ application
```c
#include "video_frame.h" // contains GVA::VideoFrame, GVA::RegionOfInterest and GVA::Tensor

void PrintMeta(GstBuffer *buffer, GstCaps *caps) { // simple function to display some tensor information
    GVA::VideoFrame video_frame(buffer, caps);
    std::vector<GVA::RegionOfInterest> regions = video_frame.regions();
    for (GVA::RegionOfInterest &roi : regions) { // iterate by regions of interest attached to this video frame
        auto bbox = roi.rect(); // get bounding box information
        std::cout << "Object bounding box " << bbox.x << "," << bbox.y << "," << bbox.w << "," << bbox.h << "," << std::endl;
        for (const GVA::Tensor &tensor : roi.tensors()) { // iterate by tensors attached to this region of interest
            if (tensor.is_detection())
                continue; // detection tensor doesn't contain classification result and hence doesn't contain label
            // print some tensor information
            std::cout << "  Attribute "     << tensor.name()       << std::endl;
            std::cout << "    label= "      << tensor.label()      << std::endl;
            std::cout << "    confidence= " << tensor.confidence() << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Access inference results with Python API
This is recommended way of dealing with inference results obtained from video analytics pipeline from Python code (via Python application or via `gvapython` element in pipeline)
```python
import gi
gi.require_version('Gst', '1.0')
from gi.repository import Gst  # contains GStreamer entities
from gstgva import VideoFrame

def PrintMeta(buffer: Gst.Buffer, caps: Gst.Caps):  # simple function to display some tensor information
    frame = VideoFrame(buffer, caps=caps)
    for roi in frame.regions():  # iterate by regions of interest attached to this video frame
        bbox = roi.rect()  # get bounding box information
        print("Object bounding box {}, {}, {}, {}".format(bbox.x, bbox.y, bbox.w, bbox.h))
        for tensor in roi.tensors():  # iterate by tensors attached to this region of interest
            if tensor.is_detection():
                continue  # detection tensor doesn't contain classification result and hence doesn't contain label
            # print some tensor information
            print("  Attribute {}".format(tensor.name()))
            print("    label= {}".format(tensor.label()))
            print("    confidence= {}".format(tensor.confidence()))
```

## Custom post-processing tutorial <a name="tutorial"></a>
There are several ways how you can access inference results provided by DL Streamer elements in GStreamer pipeline using DL Streamer API:
1. Create **C++/Python** application, which sets up callback on buffer passing through any DL Streamer element and runs video analytics pipeline. In the body of this callback GstBuffer and, hence, DL Streamer API will be available
2. Create **C++/Python** application, which runs video analytics pipeline with standard appsink element added as sink. You will then be able to register callback on GstBuffer incoming to appsink
3. Write your own GStreamer plugin which has access to GstBuffers coming through and insert it to pipeline after DL Streamer inference elements

We've got plenty examples of following ways 1 & 2 in our samples and most existing DL Streamer elements relying on existing inference result are basically based on 3rd way (e.g. **gvaclassify**, **gvatrack**, and more). Let's focus on one specific task: let's say, you have very specific deep learning model, which requires custom post-processing (**gvadetect** is not able to correctly interpret inference results of some models you can train or find on Web). You know how post processing should be implemented, but you don't know how to get and make any use of inference results produced by video analytics pipeline. To solve this task, you will need **gvainference** element, which runs deep learning model inference on passing video frame and stores raw inference result in a form of GVA::Tensor, attached to GVA::VideoFrame. So we use **gvainference** to get tensors, but how do we access these produced tensors?

Any of 3 approaches above will suffice. For the clarity of explanation, let's choose 1st one and focus on it. Also, for our tutorial we will add "custom" post-processing for SSD-like models. **gvadetect** already implements this type of post-processing, but here we will use **gvainference** and set up post-processing as callback. In your case, you will need to only put your post-processing code instead of ours.

Below you can see full snippet of **Python** code that is ready to solve your task. Take a look, and then we will talk about it closely. Note, that almost the same code can be written in **C++**.
```python
import sys
from argparse import ArgumentParser
import gi  # get Python bindings for GLib-based libraries
gi.require_version('GstVideo', '1.0')
gi.require_version('Gst', '1.0')
gi.require_version('GObject', '2.0')
from gi.repository import Gst, GstVideo, GObject

# DL Streamer API modules
from gstgva import VideoFrame, util

parser = ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
_args = parser.add_argument_group('Options')
_args.add_argument("-i", "--input", help="Required. Path to input video file",
                   required=True, type=str)
_args.add_argument("-d", "--detection_model", help="Required. Path to an .xml file with object detection model",
                   required=True, type=str)

# init GStreamer
Gst.init(sys.argv)

# post-processing code
def process_frame(frame: VideoFrame, threshold: float = 0.5) -> bool:
    width = frame.video_info().width
    height = frame.video_info().height

    for tensor in frame.tensors():
        dims = tensor.dims()
        data = tensor.data()
        object_size = dims[-1]
        for i in range(dims[-2]):
            image_id = data[i * object_size + 0]
            confidence = data[i * object_size + 2]
            x_min = int(data[i * object_size + 3] * width + 0.5)
            y_min = int(data[i * object_size + 4] * height + 0.5)
            x_max = int(data[i * object_size + 5] * width + 0.5)
            y_max = int(data[i * object_size + 6] * height + 0.5)

            if image_id != 0:
                break
            if confidence < threshold:
                continue

            frame.add_region(x_min, y_min, x_max - x_min, y_max - y_min, "car", confidence)

    return True

def detect_postproc_callback(pad, info):
    with util.GST_PAD_PROBE_INFO_BUFFER(info) as buffer:
        caps = pad.get_current_caps()
        frame = VideoFrame(buffer, caps=caps)
        status = process_frame(frame)
    return Gst.PadProbeReturn.OK if status else Gst.PadProbeReturn.DROP

def main():
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # build pipeline using parse_launch
    pipeline_str = "filesrc location={} ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGRx ! " \
        "gvainference name=gvainference model={} ! queue ! " \
        "gvawatermark ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video-sink=xvimagesink sync=false".format(
            args.input, args.detection_model)
    pipeline = Gst.parse_launch(pipeline_str)

    # set callback
    gvainference = pipeline.get_by_name("gvainference")
    if gvainference:
        pad = gvainference.get_static_pad("src")
        pad.add_probe(Gst.PadProbeType.BUFFER, detect_postproc_callback)

    # start pipeline
    pipeline.set_state(Gst.State.PLAYING)

    # wait until EOS or error
    bus = pipeline.get_bus()
    msg = bus.timed_pop_filtered(
        Gst.CLOCK_TIME_NONE, Gst.MessageType.ERROR | Gst.MessageType.EOS)

    # free pipeline
    pipeline.set_state(Gst.State.NULL)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.exit(main() or 0)
```
Let's go through the most interesting pieces. First, we import necessary Python modules:
```python
import sys
from argparse import ArgumentParser
import gi  # get Python bindings for GLib-based libraries
gi.require_version('GstVideo', '1.0')
gi.require_version('Gst', '1.0')
gi.require_version('GObject', '2.0')
from gi.repository import Gst, GstVideo, GObject

# DL Streamer API modules
from gstgva import VideoFrame, util
```
Then, we parse command-line arguments. When run this script, you should specify input video with "-i" and your detection model with "-d":
```python
parser = ArgumentParser(add_help=False)
_args = parser.add_argument_group('Options')
_args.add_argument("-i", "--input", help="Required. Path to input video file",
                   required=True, type=str)
_args.add_argument("-d", "--detection_model", help="Required. Path to an .xml file with object detection model",
                   required=True, type=str)
```
Next, function `process_frame` defines post-processing. As we said above, this code is for SSD-like models, so please feel free to replace it with your own post-processing implementation that suffices your custom model. Meanwhile, let's take a look at usage of DL Streamer API in this piece.

Tons of image information regarding current video frame can be obtain with gstgva.video_frame.VideoFrame.video_info. You can get image width, height, channels format and much more:
```python
width = frame.video_info().width
height = frame.video_info().height
```
Next, we iterate by gstgva.video_frame.VideoFrame.tensors, which were added by **gvainference**. We can get some inference result information, like gstgva.tensor.Tensor.dims (list of model output blob dimensions) and gstgva.tensor.Tensor.data (raw output blob to interpret with your post-processing code):
```python
for tensor in frame.tensors():
    dims = tensor.dims()
    data = tensor.data()
```
After we eject bounding box parameters from raw inference blob, we are ready to call gstgva.video_frame.VideoFrame.add_region with box coordinates, label and confidence as parameters.
```python
frame.add_region(x_min, y_min, x_max - x_min, y_max - y_min, "car", confidence)
```
Next, we define callback which will run `process_frame` (our post-processing code) on each video frame passing by pipeline:
```python
def detect_postproc_callback(pad, info):
    with util.GST_PAD_PROBE_INFO_BUFFER(info) as buffer:
        caps = pad.get_current_caps()
        frame = VideoFrame(buffer, caps=caps)
        status = process_frame(frame)
    return Gst.PadProbeReturn.OK if status else Gst.PadProbeReturn.DROP
```
In `main` function we create string template of video analytics pipeline with **gvainference** to run inference and **gvawatermark** to display bounding boxes and their labels (the ones we set to "face"):
```python
# build pipeline using parse_launch
pipeline_str = "filesrc location={} ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=BGRx ! " \
    "gvainference name=gvainference model={} ! queue ! " \
    "gvawatermark ! videoconvert ! fpsdisplaysink video-sink=xvimagesink sync=false".format(
    args.input, args.detection_model)
```
Finally, we register callback on **gvainference** source pad (source pad is meant to produce GstBuffer):
```python
# set callback
gvainference = pipeline.get_by_name("gvainference")
if gvainference:
    pad = gvainference.get_static_pad("src")
    pad.add_probe(Gst.PadProbeType.BUFFER, detect_postproc_callback)
```
Thus, before current frame leaves **gvainference**, `detect_postproc_callback` with access to GstBuffer will be called, where custom post-processing code is executed.

At the end of application, after all frames have passed by the pipeline, playback is finished.
